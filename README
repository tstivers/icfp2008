Built with Visual Studio 2005
All of the pathfinding is in Controllers/StupidController.cs
Probably builds with the free express version of C#
The console client is what is run from the livecd
Most testing was done using the visual client

Note: Contains a segment/circle intersection test from Box2D (thanks Erin Catto!)
